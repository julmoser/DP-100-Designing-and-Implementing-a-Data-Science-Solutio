# Lab 3 - Use AutoML and HyperDrive

## Lab 3.0: Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Understand the machine learning pipeline
- Understand Azure Machine Learning service AutoML and Hyperdrive
- Create a Python script that uses the Azure Machine Learning serviceâ€™s AutoML to recommend a model
- Test the recommended model from your Python script



## Introduction

In this lab, you want to see if there are models that perform better than the one you manually created earlier. You decide to use Azure Machine Learning service's AutoML and HyperDrive to simultaneously execute a number of different types of classification models, compare the results, and recommend the best performing model. This will save you a lot of time picking the best model so you can get the solution delivered sooner. 

## Lab 3: Resources

You will use the following files from the lab folder:

Name                            | Description
----                            | -----------
Starter_Lab3_Notebook.ipynb     | The lab notebook you should use.  Import this into your Notebook project and open it.
