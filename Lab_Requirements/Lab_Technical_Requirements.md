# Labs: Meeting the Technical Requirements

## Labs: What You Need

The labs for the data scientist and focus on using the Azure Machine Learning service to train and deploy a predictive machine learning model.

To do the labs, you need the following:
- Access to the Azure Notebook Service which is a cloud based hosting for Jupyter Notebook. You will use the free version. All the required Python libraries are pre-installed in this environment.
- An Azure subscription that can provision an Azure Machine Learning service workspace.
- The Azure Notebook for this lab.

### Account Setup

>   Your instructor will guide you through the necessary steps to get the environment up and running.   

#### Setup your Azure Account:

You may activate an Azure free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

If you have been given an Azure Pass to complete this lab, you may go to [http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/](http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/) to activate it.  Please follow the instructions at [https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/howto](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/howto), which document the activation process.  A Microsoft account may have **one free trial** on Azure and one Azure Pass associated with it, so if you have already activated an Azure Pass on your Microsoft account, you will need to use the free trial or use another Microsoft account.

> Note: Internet Explorer is not supported. We recommend using Chrome, Edge, or, Firefox.

## Lab Files

A Jupyter Notebook is provided for each lab that provides the structure of the lab.  Because Azure Machine Learning service is a very exacting technology, most of the code that interfaces with AMLS is provided ready to run.  What is left undone is to add in the Python machine learning code as that is the job of a data scientist. Bear in mind, the goal of the labs is to help the data scientist understand how to use AMLS in their work.

Lab 1 provides a comma separated (CSV) file to jump start the labs.  The assumption is that a data engineer provided the extract to the data scientist which is a typical workflow.

### Notebooks prefixed with Starting_ are the labs to be worked on.
### Notebooks prefixed with Finished_ are completed notebooks, i.e. the solution.


## Resources for future projects/learning

To deepen your understanding of the Azure Machine Learning service, and to involve your broader team in the development of data science solutions, we recommend reviewing the following resources:

- [Azure Machine Learning Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/)
- [Azure Machine Learning service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/)
